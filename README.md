### Welcome ðŸ‘‹
I'm a generalist that loves to work on projects that blur the lines between hardware and software. My work at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory allows me to actively troubleshoot and automate tests to identify faults in electrical hardware and firmware or assist with sensor R&D. Outside of work I have been enrolling in graduate level courses to ensure that my technical background remains proficent. However, most of my most enjoyable projects have been done on my own behalf to create my own learning opportunities. A variety of these projects can be seen below!
