### Welcome ðŸ‘‹
I'm a generalist that loves to work on projects that blur the lines between hardware and software. My work at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory allows me to actively troubleshoot and automate tests to identify faults in electrical hardware and firmware or assist with sensor R&D. Outside of work I have been enrolling in graduate level courses to ensure that my technical background remains proficent. However, most of my most enjoyable projects have been done on my own behalf to create my own learning opportunities. A variety of these projects can be seen below!

## Projects I've worked on:

### Lidar's Ability to Identify Wires (12/2021):

</p>
  For my robotics master course, our team implemented a turtlebot with a Velodyne Puck in Gazebo with an A* path planning algorithm to identify the sensor's ability to identify nonlinear wires of varying guage. I worked on processing the lidar point cloud and translating it to a world map that could then be handed off to the A* algorithm. The updating world map can be seen in the above gif in our gazebo test course. [Click here for the project!](https://github.com/Drojas251/mae252_autonomous_robotics)


### Raspberry Pi Dash Camera (8/2022)

I was reviewing dash cameras online and realized that I could make one myself with a lot of the hardware I had sitting around from past projects. The circuit and software were certainly more challenging than I originally thought, but it was a great opportunity to introduce myself to some crucial python skills. [The project can be found here]().

### Desk Sensor Suite (6/2022)

### Automated Leaf Area Measurements

I worked on this project for the UC Davis Bloom Lab to deploy and improve another labmate's leaf area software to increase throughput and accuracy. I completed the GUI w/ Tkinter, automatic Google Cloud image sync using their API, and designed the 3D printed enclosure and circuit myself.

#### Mother's Day Present

My mom needed a water mirror for her garden. Instead of buying her a nice one for mother's day, I made her this mess
